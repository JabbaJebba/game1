# Game Improvement Log

## 2026-05-10 — Floating Loot Text
- Added floating text feedback when mining tiles (`+1 Copper Ore`, `+1 Ruby`, etc.)
- Text rises 40px and fades over 900ms, color-coded by resource type
- Rocks: gray, Copper: orange, Iron: silver, Gold: yellow, Gems: their respective colors
- Commit: 02cd75e
- Status: ✅ Pushed. Mining now tells you exactly what you got. Next: save/load system, sound, or auto-collect radius.

## 2026-05-10 — Debris Particles
- Added debris particles when mining tiles (4-6 colored squares fly outward and fade)
- Particles match the tile color (rock, metal, gem)
- 350-600ms lifetime with random trajectory and rotation
- Commit: da365ff
- Status: ✅ Pushed. Mining now has tactile visual feedback. Next: save/load system, sound, or auto-collect radius.

## 2026-05-09 — First Automated Update
- Added screen shake on mining (60ms, intensity 0.004)
- Added mine indicator flash animation (scale up/down on hit)
- Status: Mining now has visual feedback. Next: debris particles, sound effects, or save system.

## TODO Queue (prioritized)
1. **Save/Load system** - localStorage persistence for ship, inventory, credits ✅ IN PROGRESS
2. **Better UI** - Cleaner inventory display, stats panel
3. **More content** - Additional gem types, planet variety
4. **Audio** - Mining sounds, ambient music
5. **Graphics** - Tile sprites instead of colored rectangles
6. **Character sprite** - Replace blue rectangle with animated character
7. **Day/Night impact** - Visibility reduction at night, torch system
8. **Hazards** - Falling rocks, lava, enemies
9. **Quality of life** - Auto-collect radius, better teleport mechanics
